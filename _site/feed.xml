Keeping everyone’s work organized and up-to-date can be challenging. Version control helps manage this by tracking every change made to the files and code for a project. This guide will help you understand <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">version control</code> and show you how to use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Git</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GitHub</code> to keep your e-commerce team organized and efficient.</p>

<h3 id="why-version-control-is-important-for-e-commerce-teams">Why Version Control Is Important for E-commerce Teams</h3>

<p>Version control allows teams to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">collaborate effectively</code> without overwriting each other’s work. Here’s why it’s especially useful for e-commerce teams:</p>

<ol>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Easy Tracking:</code> You can track every change, see who made it, and even go back to an older version if something breaks.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Team Collaboration:</code> Multiple team members can work on different parts of the project without conflicts.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Backup:</code> GitHub keeps a copy of the project’s history, so if something goes wrong, you can restore files.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Experimentation:</code> Version control lets you create “branches” where you can try out new ideas without affecting the main project.</li>
</ol>

<p>In short, version control helps teams stay organized, secure, and more creative.</p>

<h3 id="getting-started-with-git-and-github">Getting Started with Git and GitHub</h3>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Git</code> is a tool that tracks changes in files. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GitHub</code> is a platform where you can store your Git projects online and collaborate with others. Here’s a step-by-step guide on how e-commerce team members can start using Git and GitHub.</p>

<h4 id="step-1-set-up-git-and-github">Step 1: Set Up Git and GitHub</h4>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Create a GitHub Account
Go to GitHub’s website and sign up for a free account. Once you sign up, you’ll be able to create repositories (places where you store project files) and collaborate with your team.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Install Git
Git is a tool you’ll need on your computer. You can download it from Git’s website. Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Configure Git
Once Git is installed, open a terminal (or command prompt) and run these commands to set up your name and email for Git:</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    git config --global user.name "Your Name"
    git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>These settings help Git keep track of who is making changes.</p>

<h4 id="step-2-create-a-new-repository-on-github">Step 2: Create a New Repository on GitHub</h4>

<p>A <strong>repository</strong> (or “repo”) is like a folder that contains all the files for your project.
<img src="/assets/images/Screenshot-of-GitHub-repository-layout.jpeg" alt="Screenshot of a GitHub-repository layout, showing repository name, description, branches, commits, and pull requests sections." /></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Log in to GitHub:</strong>
After logging in, click the <strong>New</strong> button to create a new repository.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Name Your Repository:</strong>
Give your repository a descriptive name, like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ecommerce-website</code>. Add a description to explain the purpose of the repo (e.g., “This is the code for our e-commerce website”).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Choose Repository Settings:</strong>
Select <strong>Public</strong> if you want anyone to see the repo or <strong>Private</strong> if you want to keep it restricted to your team.
Check “Add a README file.” This file is a good place to describe the project, and it will be the first file in your repository.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Click Create:</strong>
Once you create the repo, GitHub will take you to its main page.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h4 id="step-3-clone-the-repository-to-your-computer">Step 3: Clone the Repository to Your Computer</h4>
<p>Now you’ll need to copy, or “clone,” the GitHub repo to your computer.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Copy the Repo Link:</strong> On your GitHub repository’s page, click the green Code button, and copy the HTTPS link.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Open Your Terminal:</strong> Go to your terminal or command prompt, and use this command to clone the repository (replace the link with your copied link):</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    git clone https://github.com/username/ecommerce-website.git
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This creates a folder on your computer with the same files as on GitHub.</p>

<h4 id="step-4-make-changes-to-your-files">Step 4: Make Changes to Your Files</h4>

<p>Now you can start working on your project! For example, a designer might edit a CSS file, or a content creator might add new product descriptions. After making changes, you need to “commit” them to record these updates in Git.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Open the Folder:</strong> Open the project folder created by git clone.</li>
  <li><strong>Edit Files:</strong> Use any text editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Notepad) to make changes to the files.</li>
  <li><strong>Save the Files:</strong> Once you finish editing, save the files.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="step-5-commit-and-push-changes-to-github">Step 5: Commit and Push Changes to GitHub</h4>
<p>After editing files, you need to “commit” (save a version of the change) and “push” (send it to GitHub).</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Stage the Changes:</strong> In your terminal, go to the project folder and use this command to tell Git which files to include:</li>
</ol>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    git add .
</code></pre></div></div>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Commit the Changes:</strong> Commit the changes with a message describing what you did:</li>
</ol>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    git commit -m "Updated product descriptions"
</code></pre></div></div>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Push to GitHub:</strong> Send your changes to GitHub:</li>
</ol>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    git push origin main
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Your changes are now saved in your GitHub repository, where your team members can see them.</p>

<h4 id="step-6-collaborate-with-your-team">Step 6: Collaborate with Your Team</h4>
<p>GitHub offers features to help teams work together effectively.
<img src="/assets/images/Diagram-of-GitHub-branches-and-pull-request-flow.jpeg" alt="Diagram of GitHub branches and pull request flow, with main branch and feature branch linked through a pull request for review." /></p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Branches:</strong> Use branches to work on new ideas without changing the main project. For example, you could create a new-design branch to test a new layout.</li>
  <li><strong>Pull Requests:</strong> After working on a branch, you can open a pull request on GitHub. A pull request lets team members review your work before adding it to the main project.</li>
  <li><strong>Code Reviews:</strong> Team members can leave comments on pull requests to give feedback, discuss ideas, or suggest changes.</li>
  <li><strong>Merge Changes:</strong> Once the team approves a pull request, you can merge it, which means adding the changes to the main project.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="step-7-track-issues-and-progress">Step 7: Track Issues and Progress</h4>
<p>GitHub also has tools for tracking tasks, bugs, and new features.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Issues:</strong> Create issues for tasks, bugs, or improvements (e.g., “Update homepage banner” or “Fix product image loading”).</li>
  <li><strong>Labels:</strong> Use labels like “design,” “content,” or “urgent” to categorize issues.</li>
  <li><strong>Assign Tasks:</strong> Assign issues to specific team members, so everyone knows who is responsible for what.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Git and GitHub help e-commerce teams stay organized, keep track of every change, and collaborate without conflicts. Here’s a quick recap:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Git</strong> helps track changes and version control on your computer.</li>
  <li><strong>GitHub</strong> provides a shared space online to store, review, and manage the project.</li>
  <li><strong>Version Control</strong> ensures that team members don’t overwrite each other’s work and can collaborate effectively.
With these tools, even non-developers can manage changes and work smoothly on e-commerce projects. Happy versioning!</li>

A <strong>headless e-commerce storefront</strong> separates the front end (the part customers see) from the back end (the part that manages products, orders, etc.). In this guide, you’ll learn how to set up a headless storefront and how GitHub can help your team work together smoothly.</p>

<h3 id="why-headless-architecture">Why Headless Architecture?</h3>

<p>Traditional e-commerce platforms combine the front end and back end, which can make it difficult to customize the user experience. Headless architecture solves this by allowing the front end and back end to be developed independently. Here are some benefits:</p>

<ol>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Better Customization:</code> You can design a unique front end without being restricted by the limitations of a full-stack e-commerce system.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Faster Performance:</code> Headless setups can be optimized for speed, making sites load faster.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Multi-Channel Flexibility:</code> A headless setup can serve multiple platforms, like web, mobile, and even IoT (Internet of Things) devices, all from a single backend.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Easier Scaling:</code> As your store grows, you can scale specific components without disrupting the entire system.</li>
</ol>

<p>By separating the parts of your e-commerce store, a headless setup can offer a more tailored experience for customers and a smoother workflow for your team.</p>

<h3 id="why-use-github-as-a-collaboration-hub">Why Use GitHub as a Collaboration Hub?</h3>

<p>When building a headless storefront, several team members work on different parts of the project. This is where GitHub becomes invaluable. GitHub is a platform that allows developers to share, review, and manage code. Here’s how GitHub supports collaboration:</p>

<ol>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Centralized Code Storage:</code> All team members can access and update the code in a single place.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Version Control:</code> GitHub saves every version of the code, allowing you to revert changes or track who made them.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Collaborative Tools:</code> GitHub offers features like pull requests, issues, and code reviews, which make it easy for developers to discuss and improve the code together.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Continuous Integration:</code> GitHub Actions (a feature in GitHub) can automatically test, build, and deploy code whenever changes are made, ensuring that the code is always ready.</li>
</ol>

<p>With GitHub as your hub, your team can work efficiently, track progress, and avoid common pitfalls like code conflicts or lost work.</p>

<h3 id="step-by-step-guide-to-building-a-headless-e-commerce-storefront">Step-by-Step Guide to Building a Headless E-commerce Storefront</h3>

<p>Let’s dive into how you can build a headless storefront and use GitHub for collaboration. We’ll break this down into five key steps.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/Step-by-Step-Guide-to-Building-Headless-Ecommerce-Storefront.png" alt="Step-by-Step Guide to Building a Headless E-commerce Storefront" /></p>

<h4 id="step-1-set-up-the-backend">Step 1: Set Up the Backend</h4>

<p>The backend is where you’ll manage products, orders, users, and other data. Popular options for a headless backend include:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Strapi:</code> An open-source headless CMS (Content Management System).</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Shopify Plus:</code> A headless e-commerce solution with a powerful API.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Magento:</code> A widely-used e-commerce platform with headless capabilities.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Steps to Set Up the Backend:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Choose a Backend Platform:</code> Select the platform that suits your needs based on features, budget, and scalability.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Install and Configure:</code> Set up the backend on a server or hosting provider and configure it according to your store’s requirements.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Set Up API Endpoints:</code> APIs allow the frontend to communicate with the backend. For example, create endpoints for products, orders, and user information.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Test the API:</code> Use tools like Postman to test the API endpoints and make sure they return the correct data.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="step-2-set-up-the-frontend">Step 2: Set Up the Frontend</h4>

<p>The frontend is the customer-facing part of your store. Popular frontend frameworks for headless e-commerce include:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Next.js:</code> A React-based framework that offers fast performance and SEO-friendly features.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Gatsby:</code> A static site generator that works well with headless CMS.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Vue Storefront:</code> A platform-agnostic frontend framework built on Vue.js.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Steps to Set Up the Frontend:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Create a New Project:</code> Use the chosen framework’s CLI (command line interface) to create a new project.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Connect to the Backend API:</code> Use the API endpoints from the backend to display products, handle orders, etc.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Design the Store:</code> Customize the layout and styling of your site to match your brand.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Test the Frontend:</code> Run the frontend locally and make sure it pulls the correct data from the backend API.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="step-3-set-up-a-github-repository">Step 3: Set Up a GitHub Repository</h4>

<p>Now that the backend and frontend are set up, let’s bring GitHub into the process to manage and collaborate on the code.</p>

<p><strong>Steps to Set Up the Repository:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Create a New GitHub Repository:</code> Go to GitHub and create a new repository. Name it something descriptive, like my-headless-storefront.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Push Code to the Repository:</code> Use Git commands to push your backend and frontend code to the GitHub repository. You can create separate folders in the repo for each part (/frontend and /backend).</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Invite Team Members:</code> Go to the repository settings and add collaborators (your team members), allowing them access to the code.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="step-4-collaborate-using-github-features">Step 4: Collaborate Using GitHub Features</h4>

<p>With the code in GitHub, you can now start collaborating effectively with your team.</p>

<p><strong>Collaboration Tools to Use:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Branches:</code> Each team member should work on their own branch. This keeps the main codebase clean and lets developers test new features without affecting others.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Pull Requests:</code> When someone finishes a feature, they can create a pull request. This allows other team members to review and discuss the changes before merging them into the main branch.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Issues:</code> Use GitHub’s Issue tracker to assign tasks and report bugs. Each issue can include comments, labels, and assignees.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Code Reviews:</code> Team members can review each other’s pull requests to ensure quality and share insights.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="step-5-set-up-github-actions-for-automation">Step 5: Set Up GitHub Actions for Automation</h4>

<p>GitHub Actions can automate tasks like testing and deployment, making collaboration smoother.</p>

<p><strong>Steps to Set Up GitHub Actions:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Create a Workflow File:</code> In the GitHub repository, go to the Actions tab and set up a new workflow (usually a YAML file named main.yml in the .github/workflows folder).</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Add Automated Tests:</code> Set up GitHub Actions to run tests whenever code is pushed. This ensures that any new code works correctly before being merged.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Deploy Automatically:</code> If you’re using a hosting service like Netlify, Vercel, or AWS, you can set up GitHub Actions to deploy changes automatically after they pass testing.</li>
</ol>

<p>Example Workflow Code for GitHub Actions:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    name: CI/CD Pipeline

        on:
        push:
            branches:
            - main

        jobs:
        build-and-deploy:
            runs-on: ubuntu-latest

            steps:
            - name: Checkout Code
            uses: actions/checkout@v2

            - name: Install Dependencies
            run: npm install

            - name: Run Tests
            run: npm test

            - name: Deploy to Netlify
            run: npx netlify-cli deploy --prod
            env:
                NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN: $
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This example automatically checks out the code, installs dependencies, runs tests, and deploys to Netlify if everything passes.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Building a headless e-commerce storefront provides flexibility and customization that’s hard to achieve with traditional platforms. By using GitHub as your collaboration hub, your team can work together efficiently, test and review code easily, and deploy updates automatically.</p>

<p>With this guide, you’re ready to set up your own headless store and make GitHub the central hub for your development team’s work.

    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>pip install selenium
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Set Up WebDriver</strong>
Selenium uses WebDriver to interact with browsers. Download the WebDriver for your preferred browser (e.g., ChromeDriver for Chrome). Place it in your project folder.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="step-3-write-a-selenium-test-script">Step 3: Write a Selenium Test Script</h4>
<p>Now, write a simple test script that automates a key function on your e-commerce site. Let’s say we want to test the search function to ensure it works properly.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Create a New File</strong>.<br />
In your repository, create a file called test_search.py.</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Write the Test Code</strong>.<br />
Here’s an example of a simple Selenium test in Python:
    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code> from selenium import webdriver
 from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
 from selenium.webdriver.common.keys import Keys
 import time

 #Set up the WebDriver
 driver = webdriver.Chrome(executable_path='./chromedriver')

 driver.get("https://example-ecommerce.com")

 #Find the search bar and perform a search
 search_bar = driver.find_element(By.NAME, "search")
 search_bar.send_keys("laptop")
 search_bar.send_keys(Keys.RETURN)

 Pause to let the page load
 time.sleep(2)

 #Verify search results appear
 results = driver.find_elements(By.CLASS_NAME, "product-item")
 assert len(results) &gt; 0, "No search results found."

 #Close the browser
 driver.quit()
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Save the File</strong>.<br />
Save <strong>test_search.py</strong> to your project folder.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="step-4-set-up-github-actions-for-automated-testing">Step 4: Set Up GitHub Actions for Automated Testing</h4>
<p>GitHub Actions lets you run tests automatically. Each time you push code to the repository, GitHub will run the test.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/GitHub-Actions-workflow-running-automated-tests-for-ecommerce-store-using-Selenium.jpeg" alt="GitHub Actions workflow running automated tests for an e-commerce store using Selenium." /></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Create a Workflow File</strong>

However, traditional version control with Git struggles with these files because they can be too big. This is where <strong>Git Large File Storage (Git LFS)</strong> helps. Git LFS allows you to store and track large files efficiently on GitHub without slowing down your workflows.</p>

<p>This guide will introduce you to Git LFS, show you how to set it up, and provide tips for managing large e-commerce files on GitHub.</p>

<h3 id="why-use-git-lfs-for-e-commerce-data">Why Use Git LFS for E-commerce Data?</h3>
<p>Here are some key benefits of using Git LFS for e-commerce data management:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Better Performance:</strong> Git LFS makes it easier to handle large files (like high-quality images and videos) by only downloading the files when you need them.</li>
  <li><strong>Easier Collaboration:</strong> Team members can work with large files without downloading every single version, saving time and storage space.</li>
  <li><strong>Version Control for Big Files:</strong> Just like with code, Git LFS lets you track changes and roll back to previous versions of large files if needed.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="step-1-install-git-lfs">Step 1: Install Git LFS</h4>
<p>To start using Git LFS, you need to install it on your computer.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Download Git LFS</strong>
Go to <a href="https://git-lfs.com">Git LFS’s website</a> and download the installer for your operating system.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Install Git LFS</strong>
After downloading, open the installer and follow the steps to install Git LFS.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Enable Git LFS for Your Project</strong>
Once installed, open your terminal (or command prompt) and enter this command to enable Git LFS for your project:</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git lfs install
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Now you’re ready to start using Git LFS with your Git projects!</p>

<h4 id="step-2-track-large-files-with-git-lfs">Step 2: Track Large Files with Git LFS</h4>
<p>Once Git LFS is installed, you can choose which types of files should be tracked. Let’s set it up for common e-commerce files, like images and videos.
<img src="/assets/images/Screenshot-showing-Git-LFS-commands-tracking-large-files.jpeg" alt="Screenshot showing Git LFS commands tracking large files, including images and videos, with a sample .gitattributes file listing tracked file types." /></p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Decide Which Files to Track</strong>
Think about which files are large and used frequently on your e-commerce site. For example:</li>
</ol>

<p>High-quality product images (.jpg, .png)
Product videos (.mp4)
Promotional graphics (.gif, .tiff)</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Tell Git LFS to Track These Files</strong>
Use the following commands to tell Git LFS to track specific file types. For example:</li>
</ol>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git lfs track "*.jpg"
git lfs track "*.png"
git lfs track "*.mp4"
</code></pre></div></div>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Confirm the Tracking</strong>
After setting this up, you can check which files are being tracked by running:</li>
</ol>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git lfs ls-files
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>You should now see the list of file types that Git LFS will manage.</p>

<h4 id="step-3-add-and-commit-files-to-your-repository">Step 3: Add and Commit Files to Your Repository</h4>
<p>Now that Git LFS is set up to track large files, you can add and commit files to your repository just like with regular Git.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Add Your Files</strong>
If you haven’t added the files to your project yet, use:</li>
</ol>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git add .
</code></pre></div></div>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Commit Your Changes</strong>
Write a commit message to record the changes:</li>
</ol>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git commit -m "Added high-quality product images with Git LFS"
</code></pre></div></div>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Push to GitHub</strong>
Finally, push the changes to GitHub:</li>
</ol>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git push origin main
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Git LFS will upload your large files to GitHub, where they are stored separately to avoid slowing down your repository.</p>

<h4 id="step-4-pull-and-clone-repositories-with-git-lfs">Step 4: Pull and Clone Repositories with Git LFS</h4>
<p>When other team members need to access your files, Git LFS will ensure they only download the large files when needed.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Clone the Repository with Git LFS</strong>
When cloning a repository that uses Git LFS, your team members should clone as usual:</li>
</ol>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
</code></pre></div></div>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Pull Updates with Git LFS</strong>
When you pull new updates, Git LFS will automatically download the large files linked to those changes.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="tips-for-managing-large-files-efficiently">Tips for Managing Large Files Efficiently</h3>
<p>Working with large media files in e-commerce can quickly get complex. Here are a few tips to help keep your Git LFS usage organized and effective:
<img src="/assets/images/Diagram-illustrating-branching-workflow-for-media-updates.jpeg" alt="Diagram showing a branching workflow for managing media updates with Git LFS, highlighting a separate branch for media files." /></p>

<h3 id="1-keep-track-of-file-sizes">1. Keep Track of File Sizes</h3>
<p>GitHub has storage limits for Git LFS, so it’s important to monitor file sizes regularly. Consider compressing images or resizing videos when possible to reduce storage space.</p>

<h3 id="2-use-branches-for-media-changes">2. Use Branches for Media Changes</h3>
<p>If you’re making big updates to your media assets (e.g., updating all product images), it’s a good idea to use a separate branch. This helps you keep the main branch clean while you’re still working on the changes.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Create a Branch for Media
    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git checkout -b update-media-assets
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>Push the Branch to GitHub
    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git push origin update-media-assets
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="3-regularly-clean-up-old-files">3. Regularly Clean Up Old Files</h3>
<p>To save storage, review old media files that are no longer needed. You can use Git LFS commands to remove specific large files from your project history.</p>

<h3 id="4-use-gitattributes-for-better-organization">4. Use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.gitattributes</code> for Better Organization</h3>
<p>Git LFS automatically creates a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.gitattributes</code> file in your project, listing which files are tracked by Git LFS. This file helps you and your team keep track of which file types are stored in Git LFS. You can review or edit this file to add or remove file types as needed.</p>

  <li><strong>Use Secrets for Sensitive Data:</strong> If you need to use passwords, API keys, or tokens, add them to GitHub Secrets. To do this, go to Settings &gt; Secrets in your repository, and add your secret keys there. This keeps sensitive information secure.</li>
  <li><strong>Monitor Workflow Runs:</strong> After you push changes, check the Actions tab to see if your workflow runs successfully. GitHub will show green (successful) or red (failed) icons. Click on them to see details.</li>
  <li><strong>Use Scheduled Workflows:</strong> You can schedule workflows to run at specific times, such as daily or weekly, which is useful for regular tasks like database backups.</li>
</ol>

<p>Example of a scheduled workflow that runs every night:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby">    <span class="ss">name: </span><span class="no">Nightly</span> <span class="no">Tasks</span>

    <span class="ss">on:
    schedule:
        </span><span class="o">-</span> <span class="ss">cron: </span><span class="s1">'0 0 * * *'</span>

    <span class="ss">jobs:
    backup:
        </span><span class="n">runs</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="ss">on: </span><span class="n">ubuntu</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">latest</span>

        <span class="ss">steps:

To save man from the morass of propaganda, in my opinion, is one of the chief aims of education. Education must enable one to sift and weigh evidence, to discern the true from the false, the real from the unreal, and the facts from the fiction.</p>

<p>Education must also train one for quick, <strong>resolute and effective thinking</strong>. To think incisively and to think for one’s self is very difficult.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We are prone to let our mental life become invaded by legions of half truths, prejudices, and propaganda. At this point, I often wonder whether or not education is fulfilling its purpose. A great majority of the so-called educated people do not think logically and scientifically.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The function of education, therefore, is to teach one to think intensively and to think critically. But education which stops with efficiency may prove the greatest menace to society. The most dangerous criminal may be the man gifted with reason, but with no morals.</p>

<p>The late Eugene Talmadge, in my opinion, possessed one of the better minds of Georgia, or even America. Moreover, he wore the Phi Beta Kappa key. By all measuring rods, Mr. Talmadge could think critically and intensively; yet he contends that I am an inferior being. Are those the types of men we call educated?</p>

<p>We must remember that intelligence is not enough. Intelligence plus character–that is the goal of true education. The complete education gives one not only power of concentration, but worthy objectives upon which to concentrate. The broad education will, therefore, transmit to one not only the accumulated knowledge of the race but also the accumulated experience of social living.</p>]]></content><author><name>sal</name></author><category term="Jekyll" /><category term="tutorial" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Even the press, the classroom, the platform, and the pulpit in many instances do not give us objective and unbiased truths.
