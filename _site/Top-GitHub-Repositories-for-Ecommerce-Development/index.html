    "title": "Version Control for E-commerce Teams: A Guide to Using Git and GitHub.",
    "body": "2024/11/12 - In an e-commerce team, many people work on different aspects of a website: developers, designers, content creators, and marketers. Keeping everyone’s work organized and up-to-date can be challenging. Version control helps manage this by tracking every change made to the files and code for a project. This guide will help you understand version control and show you how to use Git and GitHub to keep your e-commerce team organized and efficient. Why Version Control Is Important for E-commerce Teams: Version control allows teams to collaborate effectively without overwriting each other’s work. Here’s why it’s especially useful for e-commerce teams:  Easy Tracking: You can track every change, see who made it, and even go back to an older version if something breaks.  Team Collaboration: Multiple team members can work on different parts of the project without conflicts.  Backup: GitHub keeps a copy of the project’s history, so if something goes wrong, you can restore files.  Experimentation: Version control lets you create “branches” where you can try out new ideas without affecting the main project. In short, version control helps teams stay organized, secure, and more creative. Getting Started with Git and GitHub: Git is a tool that tracks changes in files. GitHub is a platform where you can store your Git projects online and collaborate with others. Here’s a step-by-step guide on how e-commerce team members can start using Git and GitHub. Step 1: Set Up Git and GitHub:    Create a GitHub AccountGo to GitHub’s website and sign up for a free account. Once you sign up, you’ll be able to create repositories (places where you store project files) and collaborate with your team.     Install GitGit is a tool you’ll need on your computer. You can download it from Git’s website. Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.     Configure GitOnce Git is installed, open a terminal (or command prompt) and run these commands to set up your name and email for Git:    git config --global user. name  Your Name   git config --global user. email  your. email@example. com These settings help Git keep track of who is making changes. Step 2: Create a New Repository on GitHub: A repository (or “repo”) is like a folder that contains all the files for your project.    Log in to GitHub:After logging in, click the New button to create a new repository.     Name Your Repository:Give your repository a descriptive name, like ecommerce-website. Add a description to explain the purpose of the repo (e. g. , “This is the code for our e-commerce website”).     Choose Repository Settings:Select Public if you want anyone to see the repo or Private if you want to keep it restricted to your team. Check “Add a README file. ” This file is a good place to describe the project, and it will be the first file in your repository.     Click Create:Once you create the repo, GitHub will take you to its main page.  Step 3: Clone the Repository to Your Computer: Now you’ll need to copy, or “clone,” the GitHub repo to your computer.    Copy the Repo Link: On your GitHub repository’s page, click the green Code button, and copy the HTTPS link.     Open Your Terminal: Go to your terminal or command prompt, and use this command to clone the repository (replace the link with your copied link):    git clone https://github. com/username/ecommerce-website. gitThis creates a folder on your computer with the same files as on GitHub. Step 4: Make Changes to Your Files: Now you can start working on your project! For example, a designer might edit a CSS file, or a content creator might add new product descriptions. After making changes, you need to “commit” them to record these updates in Git.  Open the Folder: Open the project folder created by git clone.  Edit Files: Use any text editor (e. g. , Visual Studio Code, Notepad) to make changes to the files.  Save the Files: Once you finish editing, save the files. Step 5: Commit and Push Changes to GitHub: After editing files, you need to “commit” (save a version of the change) and “push” (send it to GitHub).  Stage the Changes: In your terminal, go to the project folder and use this command to tell Git which files to include:  git add .  Commit the Changes: Commit the changes with a message describing what you did:  git commit -m  Updated product descriptions  Push to GitHub: Send your changes to GitHub:  git push origin mainYour changes are now saved in your GitHub repository, where your team members can see them. Step 6: Collaborate with Your Team: GitHub offers features to help teams work together effectively.  Branches: Use branches to work on new ideas without changing the main project. For example, you could create a new-design branch to test a new layout.  Pull Requests: After working on a branch, you can open a pull request on GitHub. A pull request lets team members review your work before adding it to the main project.  Code Reviews: Team members can leave comments on pull requests to give feedback, discuss ideas, or suggest changes.  Merge Changes: Once the team approves a pull request, you can merge it, which means adding the changes to the main project. Step 7: Track Issues and Progress: GitHub also has tools for tracking tasks, bugs, and new features.  Issues: Create issues for tasks, bugs, or improvements (e. g. , “Update homepage banner” or “Fix product image loading”).  Labels: Use labels like “design,” “content,” or “urgent” to categorize issues.  Assign Tasks: Assign issues to specific team members, so everyone knows who is responsible for what. Conclusion: Git and GitHub help e-commerce teams stay organized, keep track of every change, and collaborate without conflicts. Here’s a quick recap:  Git helps track changes and version control on your computer.  GitHub provides a shared space online to store, review, and manage the project.  Version Control ensures that team members don’t overwrite each other’s work and can collaborate effectively. With these tools, even non-developers can manage changes and work smoothly on e-commerce projects. Happy versioning!"

    "title": "Managing E-commerce Data with GitHub and Git LFS",
    "body": "2024/11/12 - For e-commerce teams, managing large files, like product images, videos, and promotional banners, is crucial. However, traditional version control with Git struggles with these files because they can be too big. This is where Git Large File Storage (Git LFS) helps. Git LFS allows you to store and track large files efficiently on GitHub without slowing down your workflows. This guide will introduce you to Git LFS, show you how to set it up, and provide tips for managing large e-commerce files on GitHub. Why Use Git LFS for E-commerce Data?: Here are some key benefits of using Git LFS for e-commerce data management:  Better Performance: Git LFS makes it easier to handle large files (like high-quality images and videos) by only downloading the files when you need them.  Easier Collaboration: Team members can work with large files without downloading every single version, saving time and storage space.  Version Control for Big Files: Just like with code, Git LFS lets you track changes and roll back to previous versions of large files if needed. Step 1: Install Git LFS: To start using Git LFS, you need to install it on your computer.    Download Git LFSGo to Git LFS’s website and download the installer for your operating system.     Install Git LFSAfter downloading, open the installer and follow the steps to install Git LFS.     Enable Git LFS for Your ProjectOnce installed, open your terminal (or command prompt) and enter this command to enable Git LFS for your project:  git lfs installNow you’re ready to start using Git LFS with your Git projects! Step 2: Track Large Files with Git LFS: Once Git LFS is installed, you can choose which types of files should be tracked. Let’s set it up for common e-commerce files, like images and videos.  Decide Which Files to TrackThink about which files are large and used frequently on your e-commerce site. For example:High-quality product images (. jpg, . png)Product videos (. mp4)Promotional graphics (. gif, . tiff)  Tell Git LFS to Track These FilesUse the following commands to tell Git LFS to track specific file types. For example:git lfs track  *. jpg git lfs track  *. png git lfs track  *. mp4  Confirm the TrackingAfter setting this up, you can check which files are being tracked by running:git lfs ls-filesYou should now see the list of file types that Git LFS will manage. Step 3: Add and Commit Files to Your Repository: Now that Git LFS is set up to track large files, you can add and commit files to your repository just like with regular Git.  Add Your FilesIf you haven’t added the files to your project yet, use:git add .  Commit Your ChangesWrite a commit message to record the changes:git commit -m  Added high-quality product images with Git LFS  Push to GitHubFinally, push the changes to GitHub:git push origin mainGit LFS will upload your large files to GitHub, where they are stored separately to avoid slowing down your repository. Step 4: Pull and Clone Repositories with Git LFS: When other team members need to access your files, Git LFS will ensure they only download the large files when needed.  Clone the Repository with Git LFSWhen cloning a repository that uses Git LFS, your team members should clone as usual:git clone https://github. com/username/repository. git Pull Updates with Git LFSWhen you pull new updates, Git LFS will automatically download the large files linked to those changes. Tips for Managing Large Files Efficiently: Working with large media files in e-commerce can quickly get complex. Here are a few tips to help keep your Git LFS usage organized and effective: 1. Keep Track of File Sizes: GitHub has storage limits for Git LFS, so it’s important to monitor file sizes regularly. Consider compressing images or resizing videos when possible to reduce storage space. 2. Use Branches for Media Changes: If you’re making big updates to your media assets (e. g. , updating all product images), it’s a good idea to use a separate branch. This helps you keep the main branch clean while you’re still working on the changes.  Create a Branch for Media  git checkout -b update-media-assets    Push the Branch to GitHub  git push origin update-media-assets   3. Regularly Clean Up Old Files: To save storage, review old media files that are no longer needed. You can use Git LFS commands to remove specific large files from your project history. 4. Use . gitattributes for Better Organization: Git LFS automatically creates a . gitattributes file in your project, listing which files are tracked by Git LFS. This file helps you and your team keep track of which file types are stored in Git LFS. You can review or edit this file to add or remove file types as needed. Conclusion: Using Git LFS makes it much easier to handle large e-commerce files on GitHub. Here’s a quick recap:  Install Git LFS to track large files.  Choose the files to track, such as images and videos.  Add and commit these files to your Git repository.  Pull and clone repositories to keep files organized for all team members.  Manage your large files efficiently to keep your repository fast and organized. With Git LFS, you can manage large data files for your e-commerce site while keeping your GitHub repository organized and easy to use. "

    "title": "Building a Headless E-commerce Storefront: GitHub as Your Collaboration Hub",
    "body": "2024/11/12 - E-commerce is constantly evolving, and headless architecture is becoming one of the most popular choices for online stores. A headless e-commerce storefront separates the front end (the part customers see) from the back end (the part that manages products, orders, etc. ). In this guide, you’ll learn how to set up a headless storefront and how GitHub can help your team work together smoothly. Why Headless Architecture?: Traditional e-commerce platforms combine the front end and back end, which can make it difficult to customize the user experience. Headless architecture solves this by allowing the front end and back end to be developed independently. Here are some benefits:  Better Customization: You can design a unique front end without being restricted by the limitations of a full-stack e-commerce system.  Faster Performance: Headless setups can be optimized for speed, making sites load faster.  Multi-Channel Flexibility: A headless setup can serve multiple platforms, like web, mobile, and even IoT (Internet of Things) devices, all from a single backend.  Easier Scaling: As your store grows, you can scale specific components without disrupting the entire system. By separating the parts of your e-commerce store, a headless setup can offer a more tailored experience for customers and a smoother workflow for your team. Why Use GitHub as a Collaboration Hub?: When building a headless storefront, several team members work on different parts of the project. This is where GitHub becomes invaluable. GitHub is a platform that allows developers to share, review, and manage code. Here’s how GitHub supports collaboration:  Centralized Code Storage: All team members can access and update the code in a single place.  Version Control: GitHub saves every version of the code, allowing you to revert changes or track who made them.  Collaborative Tools: GitHub offers features like pull requests, issues, and code reviews, which make it easy for developers to discuss and improve the code together.  Continuous Integration: GitHub Actions (a feature in GitHub) can automatically test, build, and deploy code whenever changes are made, ensuring that the code is always ready. With GitHub as your hub, your team can work efficiently, track progress, and avoid common pitfalls like code conflicts or lost work. Step-by-Step Guide to Building a Headless E-commerce Storefront: Let’s dive into how you can build a headless storefront and use GitHub for collaboration. We’ll break this down into five key steps.  Step 1: Set Up the Backend: The backend is where you’ll manage products, orders, users, and other data. Popular options for a headless backend include:  Strapi: An open-source headless CMS (Content Management System).  Shopify Plus: A headless e-commerce solution with a powerful API.  Magento: A widely-used e-commerce platform with headless capabilities. Steps to Set Up the Backend:  Choose a Backend Platform: Select the platform that suits your needs based on features, budget, and scalability.  Install and Configure: Set up the backend on a server or hosting provider and configure it according to your store’s requirements.  Set Up API Endpoints: APIs allow the frontend to communicate with the backend. For example, create endpoints for products, orders, and user information.  Test the API: Use tools like Postman to test the API endpoints and make sure they return the correct data. Step 2: Set Up the Frontend: The frontend is the customer-facing part of your store. Popular frontend frameworks for headless e-commerce include:  Next. js: A React-based framework that offers fast performance and SEO-friendly features.  Gatsby: A static site generator that works well with headless CMS.  Vue Storefront: A platform-agnostic frontend framework built on Vue. js. Steps to Set Up the Frontend:  Create a New Project: Use the chosen framework’s CLI (command line interface) to create a new project.  Connect to the Backend API: Use the API endpoints from the backend to display products, handle orders, etc.  Design the Store: Customize the layout and styling of your site to match your brand.  Test the Frontend: Run the frontend locally and make sure it pulls the correct data from the backend API. Step 3: Set Up a GitHub Repository: Now that the backend and frontend are set up, let’s bring GitHub into the process to manage and collaborate on the code. Steps to Set Up the Repository:  Create a New GitHub Repository: Go to GitHub and create a new repository. Name it something descriptive, like my-headless-storefront.  Push Code to the Repository: Use Git commands to push your backend and frontend code to the GitHub repository. You can create separate folders in the repo for each part (/frontend and /backend).  Invite Team Members: Go to the repository settings and add collaborators (your team members), allowing them access to the code. Step 4: Collaborate Using GitHub Features: With the code in GitHub, you can now start collaborating effectively with your team. Collaboration Tools to Use:  Branches: Each team member should work on their own branch. This keeps the main codebase clean and lets developers test new features without affecting others.  Pull Requests: When someone finishes a feature, they can create a pull request. This allows other team members to review and discuss the changes before merging them into the main branch.  Issues: Use GitHub’s Issue tracker to assign tasks and report bugs. Each issue can include comments, labels, and assignees.  Code Reviews: Team members can review each other’s pull requests to ensure quality and share insights. Step 5: Set Up GitHub Actions for Automation: GitHub Actions can automate tasks like testing and deployment, making collaboration smoother. Steps to Set Up GitHub Actions:  Create a Workflow File: In the GitHub repository, go to the Actions tab and set up a new workflow (usually a YAML file named main. yml in the . github/workflows folder).  Add Automated Tests: Set up GitHub Actions to run tests whenever code is pushed. This ensures that any new code works correctly before being merged.  Deploy Automatically: If you’re using a hosting service like Netlify, Vercel, or AWS, you can set up GitHub Actions to deploy changes automatically after they pass testing. Example Workflow Code for GitHub Actions:   name: CI/CD Pipeline    on:    push:      branches:      - main    jobs:    build-and-deploy:      runs-on: ubuntu-latest      steps:      - name: Checkout Code      uses: actions/checkout@v2      - name: Install Dependencies      run: npm install      - name: Run Tests      run: npm test      - name: Deploy to Netlify      run: npx netlify-cli deploy --prod      env:        NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets. NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN }}This example automatically checks out the code, installs dependencies, runs tests, and deploys to Netlify if everything passes. Conclusion: Building a headless e-commerce storefront provides flexibility and customization that’s hard to achieve with traditional platforms. By using GitHub as your collaboration hub, your team can work together efficiently, test and review code easily, and deploy updates automatically. With this guide, you’re ready to set up your own headless store and make GitHub the central hub for your development team’s work. Happy coding! "

    "body": "2024/11/12 - Automated testing is essential for e-commerce platforms. Every feature, from product browsing to checkout, must work smoothly. Automated testing lets you detect bugs early and keep the site reliable for users. With GitHub Actions and Selenium, you can set up automated UI tests to run each time you update the code, ensuring every change is thoroughly tested. This guide will show you how to set up automated tests for an e-commerce site using Selenium in GitHub Actions. We’ll cover the basics, explain the benefits, and walk through each step to create an automated testing workflow. Why Use Automated Testing for E-commerce?: Automated testing brings several benefits to e-commerce teams:  Catch Errors Early: Automated tests check your website every time you make a change, helping to find issues quickly.  Consistent User Experience: Regular testing makes sure key user interactions, like searching and checking out, work smoothly.  Save Time and Effort: Automation reduces the time spent on manual testing, so the team can focus on improving the site.  Improve Stability: Automated testing helps to keep the website stable and reliable, increasing customer trust. Step 1: Set Up Your GitHub Repository: To get started, create a new repository on GitHub or use an existing one where your e-commerce code is stored.  Create a RepositoryGo to GitHub and click on New Repository. Give it a name, and set it to public or private.  Clone the RepositoryClone the repository to your local machine:  git clone https://github. com/username/your-repository. git   Step 2: Install Selenium for Automated Testing: Selenium is a popular tool for automating web browsers. You can write test scripts in Python to automate tasks like navigating, clicking buttons, and filling out forms.  Install SeleniumMake sure you have Python installed, then install Selenium with this command:  pip install selenium    Set Up WebDriverSelenium uses WebDriver to interact with browsers. Download the WebDriver for your preferred browser (e. g. , ChromeDriver for Chrome). Place it in your project folder. Step 3: Write a Selenium Test Script: Now, write a simple test script that automates a key function on your e-commerce site. Let’s say we want to test the search function to ensure it works properly.    Create a New File. In your repository, create a file called test_search. py.   Write the Test Code. Here’s an example of a simple Selenium test in Python:   from selenium import webdriver from selenium. webdriver. common. by import By from selenium. webdriver. common. keys import Keys import time #Set up the WebDriver driver = webdriver. Chrome(executable_path='. /chromedriver') Open the e-commerce site driver. get( https://example-ecommerce. com ) #Find the search bar and perform a search search_bar = driver. find_element(By. NAME,  search ) search_bar. send_keys( laptop ) search_bar. send_keys(Keys. RETURN) Pause to let the page load time. sleep(2) #Verify search results appear results = driver. find_elements(By. CLASS_NAME,  product-item ) assert len(results) &gt; 0,  No search results found.   #Close the browser driver. quit()    Save the File. Save test_search. py to your project folder. Step 4: Set Up GitHub Actions for Automated Testing: GitHub Actions lets you run tests automatically. Each time you push code to the repository, GitHub will run the test.     Create a Workflow FileIn your repository, create a new directory: . github/workflows/. Inside, create a file named test. yml.   Configure the WorkflowOpen test. yml and add the following YAML code:   name: Run Selenium Tests on: push:   branches:   - main pull_request:   branches:   - main jobs: test:   runs-on: ubuntu-latest   steps:   - name: Checkout Repository   uses: actions/checkout@v2   - name: Set up Python   uses: actions/setup-python@v2   with:     python-version: '3. x'   - name: Install Dependencies   run: |     python -m pip install --upgrade pip     pip install selenium   - name: Run Tests   run: |     python test_search. py    Save and Push ChangesAdd, commit, and push your changes to GitHub:   git add . git commit -m  Set up Selenium tests with GitHub Actions  git push origin main    GitHub Actions will automatically run your test whenever you push changes to the main branch or open a pull request.  Step 5: View the Test Results: Each time the workflow runs, you can view the test results on GitHub.  Open the GitHub RepositoryGo to the Actions tab in your repository.  Check the Workflow RunYou’ll see a list of recent workflow runs. Click on the latest run to view details.  Review Test OutputIf the test passes, you’ll see a green checkmark. If it fails, review the output to find any issues. Tips for Effective E-commerce Test Automation:  Automate Key User Actions: Focus on automating essential actions, like adding items to the cart, checking out, and searching for products.  Run Tests Regularly: Set up tests to run on each code change to catch errors before they affect users. Monitor Test Results: Keep an eye on your test results and fix any failures promptly. Consistently passing tests show your site is reliable. Conclusion: Using GitHub Actions and Selenium together makes it easy to automate testing for your e-commerce site. With automated tests, you can keep your site functioning smoothly, catch issues early, and improve the overall shopping experience. Here’s a quick recap of the steps:  Set up your GitHub repository.

    "title": "How to Use GitHub Actions for E-commerce Workflows",
    "body": "2024/11/11 - In e-commerce development, repetitive tasks like testing, building, and deploying updates can take up a lot of time. GitHub Actions is a tool that automates these tasks, saving you time and reducing errors. In this guide, you’ll learn how to use GitHub Actions to improve your e-commerce workflows. What is GitHub Actions?: GitHub Actions is a feature of GitHub that lets you automate processes in your projects. It uses workflows, which are files that define automated tasks, like testing code or deploying updates. These workflows run automatically when certain events happen in your GitHub repository, like when you push new code. Why Use GitHub Actions for E-commerce?: For e-commerce, GitHub Actions can help with tasks like:  Running tests to check if everything works correctly.  Building and deploying updates to your site.  Automating security checks.  Sending notifications when specific events happen. Getting Started: Setting Up GitHub Actions: Step 1: Create a New Workflow:  Go to your GitHub repository.  Click on the Actions tab at the top.  You’ll see a variety of workflow templates. For this guide, select “Simple Workflow” or “New workflow”.  GitHub will create a new file called main. yml in a . github/workflows folder. This file defines the actions you want to automate. Step 2: Add Basic Workflow Code: In the main. yml file, you can add code that tells GitHub Actions what tasks to run and when. Here’s an example of a simple workflow:   name: E-commerce Workflow  on:  push:    branches:    - main  jobs:  build-and-test:    runs-on: ubuntu-latest    steps:    - name: Check out code    uses: actions/checkout@v2    - name: Set up Node. js    uses: actions/setup-node@v2    with:      node-version: '14'    - name: Install dependencies    run: npm install    - name: Run tests    run: npm testThis code does the following:  Triggers the workflow when you push code to the main branch.  Checks out code from your repository.  Sets up Node. js, which is used for many JavaScript e-commerce applications.  Installs dependencies (libraries your project needs).  Runs tests to make sure everything is working. Common E-commerce Workflows with GitHub Actions: Workflow 1: Running Tests Automatically: Testing is essential to ensure your e-commerce site runs smoothly. You can set up GitHub Actions to run tests every time you make changes. Here’s an example:   name: Run Tests  on: [push, pull_request]  jobs:  test:    runs-on: ubuntu-latest    steps:    - name: Check out code      uses: actions/checkout@v2    - name: Install dependencies      run: npm install    - name: Run tests      run: npm testThis workflow:  Runs tests when you push changes or create a pull request.  Helps you catch any issues before deploying to your e-commerce site. Workflow 2: Deploying Your E-commerce Site: After testing, you may want to automatically deploy changes to your site. For example, if you host on a service like Netlify or Vercel, you can use GitHub Actions to trigger deployments. Here’s an example for deploying to Netlify:   name: Deploy to Netlify  on:  push:    branches:    - main  jobs:  deploy:    runs-on: ubuntu-latest    steps:    - name: Check out code      uses: actions/checkout@v2    - name: Install dependencies      run: npm install    - name: Build project      run: npm run build    - name: Deploy to Netlify      run: npx netlify-cli deploy --prod      env:      NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN: $In this workflow:  It builds your project after you push to the main branch.  Then, it deploys the site to Netlify using the Netlify CLI.  Secrets like NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN store sensitive data safely in GitHub. Workflow 3: Running Security Checks: Security is vital in e-commerce. GitHub Actions can help you automatically scan for vulnerabilities. Use the Dependabot Action to check for any security issues in your dependencies:   name: Dependency Review  on:  push:    paths:    - '**/package-lock. json'    - '**/yarn. lock'  jobs:  security:    runs-on: ubuntu-latest    steps:    - name: Check out code      uses: actions/checkout@v2    - name: Run dependency review      uses: github/codeql-action/analyze@v1This workflow:  Runs security checks whenever you update package-lock. json or yarn. lock.  Alerts you to vulnerabilities so you can fix them before they affect your customers. Tips for Working with GitHub Actions:  Use Secrets for Sensitive Data: If you need to use passwords, API keys, or tokens, add them to GitHub Secrets. To do this, go to Settings &gt; Secrets in your repository, and add your secret keys there. This keeps sensitive information secure.  Monitor Workflow Runs: After you push changes, check the Actions tab to see if your workflow runs successfully. GitHub will show green (successful) or red (failed) icons. Click on them to see details.  Use Scheduled Workflows: You can schedule workflows to run at specific times, such as daily or weekly, which is useful for regular tasks like database backups. Example of a scheduled workflow that runs every night:   name: Nightly Tasks  on:  schedule:    - cron: '0 0 * * *'  jobs:  backup:    runs-on: ubuntu-latest    steps:    - name: Check out code      uses: actions/checkout@v2    - name: Backup database      run: . /backup-script. shConclusion: Using GitHub Actions for e-commerce workflows can make your development process smoother and more efficient. By automating tasks like testing, deploying, and security checks, you’ll have more time to focus on growing your business and improving your site. Start with the examples here, and explore more GitHub Actions to find the ones that best suit your e-commerce project’s needs. Happy automating! "

As I engage in the so-called “bull sessions” around and about the school, I too often find that most college men have a misconception of the purpose of education. Most of the “brethren” think that education should equip them with the proper instruments of exploitation so that they can forever trample over the masses. Still others think that education should furnish them with noble ends rather than means to an end. It seems to me that education has a two-fold function to perform in the life of man and in society: the one is utility and the other is culture. Education must enable a man to become more efficient, to achieve with increasing facility the ligitimate goals of his life. "

Produced by the Boston-based publisher Louis Prang, this is the first in their “Doll Series”, a set of five “die-cut” books, known also as shape books — the other titles being Robinson Crusoe, Goody Two-Shoes (also written by Red Riding Hood author Lydia Very), Cinderella, and King Winter.

Such books are, of course, still popular in children’s publishing today, though the die cutting is not now limited to mere outlines, as evidenced in a beautiful 2014 version of the same Little Red Riding Hood story.

To save man from the morass of propaganda, in my opinion, is one of the chief aims of education. Education must enable one to sift and weigh evidence, to discern the true from the false, the real from the unreal, and the facts from the fiction. Education must also train one for quick, resolute and effective thinking. To think incisively and to think for one’s self is very difficult.  We are prone to let our mental life become invaded by legions of half truths, prejudices, and propaganda. At this point, I often wonder whether or not education is fulfilling its purpose. A great majority of the so-called educated people do not think logically and scientifically. The function of education, therefore, is to teach one to think intensively and to think critically. But education which stops with efficiency may prove the greatest menace to society. The most dangerous criminal may be the man gifted with reason, but with no morals. The late Eugene Talmadge, in my opinion, possessed one of the better minds of Georgia, or even America. Moreover, he wore the Phi Beta Kappa key. By all measuring rods, Mr. Talmadge could think critically and intensively; yet he contends that I am an inferior being. Are those the types of men we call educated? We must remember that intelligence is not enough. Intelligence plus character–that is the goal of true education. The complete education gives one not only power of concentration, but worthy objectives upon which to concentrate. The broad education will, therefore, transmit to one not only the accumulated knowledge of the race but also the accumulated experience of social living. "

As with the last post about the editor, you’ll want to be actually editing this post as you read it so that you can see all the Markdown code we’re using. Special formatting: As well as bold and italics, you can also use some other special formatting in Markdown when the need arises, for example:  strike through ==highlight== *escaped characters*Writing code blocks: There are two types of code elements which can be inserted in Markdown, the first is inline, and the other is block. Inline code is formatted by wrapping any word or words in back-ticks, like this. Larger snippets of code can be displayed across multiple lines using triple back ticks: . my-link {  text-decoration: underline;}If you want to get really fancy, you can even add syntax highlighting using Rouge.  Reference lists: The quick brown jumped over the lazy. Another way to insert links in markdown is using reference lists. You might want to use this style of linking to cite reference material in a Wikipedia-style. All of the links are listed at the end of the document, so you can maintain full separation between content and its source or reference. Full HTML: Perhaps the best part of Markdown is that you’re never limited to just Markdown. You can write HTML directly in the Markdown editor and it will just work as HTML usually does. No limits!

First mentioned as the “Citadel of București” in 1459, it became the residence of the famous Wallachian prince Vlad III the Impaler. Early 18th century woodcut of Bucharest: The Ottomans appointed Greek administrators (Phanariotes) to run the town from the 18th century. A short-lived revolt initiated by Tudor Vladimirescu in 1821 led to the end of the rule of Constantinople Greeks in Bucharest. [19] The Old Princely Court (Curtea Veche) was erected by Mircea Ciobanul in the mid-16th century. Under subsequent rulers, Bucharest was established as the summer residence of the royal court. During the years to come, it competed with Târgoviște on the status of capital city after an increase in the importance of southern Muntenia brought about by the demands of the suzerain power – the Ottoman Empire. Bucharest finally became the permanent location of the Wallachian court after 1698 (starting with the reign of Constantin Brâncoveanu). Partly destroyed by natural disasters and rebuilt several times during the following 200 years, and hit by Caragea’s plague in 1813–14, the city was wrested from Ottoman control and occupied at several intervals by the Habsburg Monarchy (1716, 1737, 1789) and Imperial Russia (three times between 1768 and 1806). It was placed under Russian administration between 1828 and the Crimean War, with an interlude during the Bucharest-centred 1848 Wallachian revolution. Later, an Austrian garrison took possession after the Russian departure (remaining in the city until March 1857). On 23 March 1847, a fire consumed about 2,000 buildings, destroying a third of the city. "
